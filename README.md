A model of 3D gallery. Threejs. Tween.js. oryginal orbitControls was modified {left button mouse for rotate left/right and pan back/forward // right button for pan // scroll for dolly // double click for zooming on pc}

problem: on mobile: there is a conflict two points of touch (moving) are read as doubleClick. doubleClick turn off for mobiles.

best experience on PC (bigger screens)
