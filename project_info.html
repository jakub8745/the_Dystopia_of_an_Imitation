        <i>&#8195;The Dystopia of an Imitation</i> by Jaroslaw (Jarek) Solecki is a virtual
        installation created in 3D technology inspired by the paintings of
        Johannes Vermeeer, in particular his famous <i>The Milkmaid</i> (from around
        1657–1661). </br>&#8195;This small-sized work (45,5 × 41 cm) begins to draw us
        in, sweeping us off into a space that belongs only to it. It becomes
        even more fascinating when we notice that the composition, which at
        first glance looked like an accurate depiction of details, is
        manipulated by the artist's decisions. </br>The original painting can
        be found in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam (SK-A-2344). </br>&#8195;On the gallery's
        wall can be seen a reproduction of <i>The Milkmaid</i>, but the portrayed woman
        presents empty hands instead of a pitcher. The pitcher itself has become
        the main object of the installation. It is based on a scan of a
        quasi-Dutch coffee mug, which during the process of analysis and
        conceptualisation became a pitcher from a Vermeer painting. </br>&#8195;Further
        information about the project, as well as the theoretical findings,
        can be read in the bilingual booklet <i>The Dystopia of an Imitation</i> by
        Jarosław Solecki. </br>Curatorship of the exhibition: dr Justyna Gorzkowicz</br>
